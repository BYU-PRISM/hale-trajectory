                        Developed by C. Gueymard

                                  *****

   THE CHANGES THAT OCCURRED IN THE SUCCESSIVE VERSIONS OF SMARTS2 ARE
   DOCUMENTED BELOW.
 
*	Version 2.0, Feb. 1994, corresponds to the ASES SOLAR'94 Conf. paper: 
	"Updated transmittance functions for use
	in fast spectral direct beam irradiance models"

*	Version 2.5, June 1994. Revisions include:
	- Modified extraterrestrial spectrum with new data from UARS
		(pers. comm. with Michael van Hoosier, NRL, May 1994)
	- Revised water vapor and mixed gases absorption coefficients
	- Revised water vapor and mixed gases transmittance functions
	- Revised diffuse irradiance on the horizontal
	- Revised transposition for tilted planes (returning to isotropic
		for wavelengths < 0.35 µm)
	- Added new default values when using reference atmospheres at
		elevated sites (up to 4 km altitude) with interpolation
		using a 4 pt. Lagrange scheme
	- Improved input data handling
	- Use a fit of alpha = f(humidity) for each default aerosol type
	- Use a fit of omegl=f(humidity, wavelength) for each aerosol type

*	Version 2.5.1, July 1994 with the following revisions:
	- Fixed error resulting from input card 4a for IH2O=2
	- Modified the calculation of relative humidity so that RH=0.0 if 
	the user inputs W=0.
	- Modified the relationship between turbidity and visibility (input
	card 9a with ITURB=3 or 4) by replacing the King & Buckius equation
	by a newly-developed fit based on Shettle & Fenn/MODTRAN2 results.
	- Added the calculation of the extra-terrestrial illuminance and
	luminous efficacy.

*	VERSION 2.5.2, Aug. 1994
	- Fixed error when §=0. is input
	- Fixed initialization of E.T. illuminance
	- Corrected formula for luminous efficacy of the E.T. spectrum

*	VERSION 2.5.3, Aug. 1994
	- Fixed inconsistencies related to the choice of using
	reference atmospheres
	- Modified the input sequence accordingly; TAIR, RH and SEASON
	are now required whenever a ref. atm. is not selected. See new
	comments on CARDS 2, 3 and 4.
	- It is now possible to have the pressure determined or interpolated
	from the ref. atm. data file.
	- Used a simplified fit for THICK.
	- Added a correction for the temperature gradient to estimate
	TGRND (sea-level temperature) from TAIR when a user defined atm.
	is selected and Z>0.

*	VERSION 2.6, Oct. 1994
	- Modified the calculation of the sun's position, now using the 
	Astronomical Almanac "low precision formula", with which declination
	is accurate to better than 0.01 deg. Refraction is considered
	prior to calculation of optical masses and
	now depends on pressure and temperature. 
	Note that Z (APPARENT zenith angle) must be ²91 deg. 
	Z>90 deg. means that the sun is below the apparent horizon; it may still
	be visible at sunrise/sunset in mountain areas or from an airplane.
	However, the accuracy for Z>85 deg. is questionable in most parts of
	the spectrum due to lack of reference data. (The accuracy is
	good, at least in the UV-B, for Z<89.5 deg.) 
	Time must now be entered as LST (Local Standard Time), therefore, no
	adjustment is needed for Daylight Savings Time.
	Day must now be entered as the day-of-year number (e.g., 32 for Feb. 1)
	Note that input card 17a has been modified accordingly.
	Changed the sign convention for azimuths and longitudes (to conform to
	the astronomical convention).
	- Corrected the default O3 values for the 4 supplementary atmospheres.
	- Added default values for the NO2 total column, corresponding to
	stratospheric loading only; a new input card is added, asking
	if the default OR the user value of NO2 shall be used.
	- Added 3 standard aerosol types from the SRA/IAMAP atmospheric model;
	the input aerosol types names have been changed for clarity.
	- Corrected the function beta=f(Visi) to obtain beta=0 if Visi=340 km
	(its maximum value for a pure Rayleigh atmosphere).
	- Corrected the fits to obtain OMEGL (the aerosol single scattering
	albedo) more accurately for the SRA and Shettle & Fenn aerosol models.
	- Introduced a new function to calculate FA (the aerosol forward
	scatterance) as a function of zenith angle and asymmetry parameter.
	- Introduced fits to obtain the asymmetry parameter, g, as a function
	of wavelength and humidity, for the reference aerosol types; 
	if the aerosol is user-defined, g becomes a necessary input, but
	is considered constant throughout the spectrum.
	- Modified the circumsolar correction factor to have a variable
	opening angle of the simulated radiometer; a new input card is added
	to ask if the circumsolar correction shall be calculated; if yes, the
	radiometer total opening angle input is asked for.
	- Modified the input of air temperature, so that the average O3 temp.
	is now calculated from a daily average instead of the previously used 
	instantaneous value.
	- Modified the sky reflectance function in the UV so that it is now
	close to rigorous predictions.
	- Modified the diffuse radiation parameterization to match reference
	caculations and measurements in the UV, down to about 280 nm.
	- Added DOUBLE PRECISION for some variables that decrease to near
	zero in the UV.
	- Added optional calculations in the UV (see new input card 16),
	with UV-A and UV-B total irradiances, as well as band irradiances 
	weighted by some action spectra for erythema, ADN damage, etc.
	- Corrected a small bug in the filter/scanning function.
	
*	VERSION 2.6.1, Nov. 1994
	- Moved the comments on the input cards that were in the main program
	into the README.TOO file.
	- Fixed a bug in the ozone optical thickness calculation (that
	could become <0 at very low temperatures).
	- Improved the calculation of the aerosol forward scatterance and
	ozone pseudo-transmittance for a better diffuse irradiance
	determination (it was too low in the visible with v. 2.6).
	- Replaced the (probably incorrect) fit by Bjorn of the Parrish et al.
	action spectrum by fits for the recently published SCUP (Skin Cancer 
	Utrecht-Philadelphia) action spectra of de Gruijl & Van der Leun (1994).
	- Improved the formatting of some outputs.
	- Cleaned the SPCTRM.DAT file for extraneous data (tip courtesy of 
	Dr. Kambezidis).
	- Added more Double Precision variables to avoid possible computational
	problems with some Fortran compilers (tip courtesy Dr. Molineaux).
	
*	VERSION 2.6.2, Dec. 1994, corresponds to FSEC report PF-270-94
	- Added XCHECK as a Double Precision variable.
	- Removed all X-marks in the first column as they may not be
	interpretable by some compilers.
	- Corrected some misprinted ozone absorption coefficients
	for the UV-A band in SPCTRM.DAT.
	- Corrected some misprinted mixed gas absorption coefficients
	above 2000 nm in SPCTRM.DAT.
	
*	VERSION 2.6.3, Jan. 1995
	- Fixed minor inconsistencies in the way ground and sea-level
	temperatures were echoed.
	- Fixed minor inconsistencies in the way wavelengths and wavelength
	intervals were used during the numerical integration process leading to
	broadband results. Full spectrum (280-4000 nm) integrations remain
	unchanged, but partial integrations may slightly differ.
	- Changed Real to Integer formats for the wavelength inputs and in most
	calculations.
	- Introduced the option ILLUM=2 to specifically calculate the luminous
	efficacy (ILLUM=1 does not offer this time consuming result any more).
	- Added an executable for PC users, as compiled by MS Fortran 5.1.
	- Corrected a missing digit in the last coefficient of the VLAMBDA.DAT
	file.
	
*	VERSION 2.7, Oct. 1995
	- Replaced the interim broadband circumsolar correction by a physical
	model. This calculation is optional and use the aerosol model selected by
	the user. A maximum 10¡ half cone is considered, with single scattering
	from aerosols and multiple scattering by molecules. The actual penumbra
	function of the simulated radiometer can be approximated from its geometry.
	- Replaced the fixed broadband albedos (zonal and local) by user-selected
	albedo models. Besides the fixed broadband Lambertian albedo option, a 
	user-defined spectral reflectance dataset can be read (from file 
	ALBEDO.DAT) and be specified either Lambertian or non-Lambertian. The non-
	Lambertian option will add calculations for increased reflectance at
	larger zenith angles. The calculation of spectral, non-Lambertian 
	reflectance of water (or calm oceans) is also optional. A library of 16
	user-selectable spectral reflectance datasets is offered for different
	natural and artificial surfaces. They are considered non-Lambertian.
	The zonal and local reflectances thus defined can be the same or not.
	- The calculation of irradiances on a tilted plane is now optional. A
	tracking surface (always normal to the sun rays) can be defined.
	- Modified the diffuse irradiance transposition for tilted surfaces. The
	transition between the isotropic and anisotropic calculations now depends
	on the ratio between the aerosol and Rayleigh optical thicknesses.
	- The spectral results can be output to either one or both of the regular
	output file (SMARTS2.OUT) and the spreadsheet file (SMARTS2.EXT). The
	latter's content is optional, for a maximum of 24 variables to be selected
	from a maximum of 32 possible. Each column has a header. This file can be
	read directly by a spreadsheet or graphics program.
	- Modified the optical air mass iterative algorithm. Its acceptable
	maximum value is now 57.3 (for a zenith angle of 91.0¡).
	- Fixed minor inconsistencies in the solar position algorithm.
	- Fixed minor errors in the extraterrestrial spectrum.
	- Fixed a bug in the scanning function.
	- Used different compilers: Language Systems Fortran 3.3 for the Mac
	version, and Lahey Fortran 5.01 for the PC/DOS version. The Mac version
	has three different executables optimized for different machines.
	- Fixed a bug affecting pressure corrections with ISPR=0. (Fixed 
	18 Mar. 96).
	- Fixed a bug affecting the PC version only, which could not produce a
	correct backscattering calculation over a Lambertian surface. (Fixed
	1 Aug. 96).
	
*	VERSION 2.8, Nov. 1996
	- Fixed a bug in the temperature correction of ozone absorption. It
	affected wavelengths in the 561-1091 and 3120-3750 nm spectral ranges.
	(Thanks to Benoit Molineaux.)
	- Modified the extraterrestrial spectrum in the 412-4000 nm range to
	reflect the new spectrum in MODTRAN3. It is essentially a degraded version
	of the latter's relatively high-resolution spectrum (1 cm-1 intervals),
	with some corrections. The essential difference is around the 940-nm water
	vapor band, where the irradiance is now 2-4% larger. The 280-4000 nm
	irradiance is now 1349.7 W/m2, compared to 1349.5 previously, and
	1354.1 W/m2 for MODTRAN3.
	- Introduced another option in illuminance calculations. The ILLUM
	parameter may now be set to -2, -1, 0, 1 , or 2. 
	ILLUM=0 is for no illuminance calculations, as before.
	ILLUM=-1 or 1 is for supplemental illuminance calculations. 
	ILLUM=-2 or 2 is for both supplemental illuminance and luminous efficacy
	calculations. 
	ILLUM=-1 and -2 have been introduced so that the old CIE (1924) Vlambda 
	curve (for the standard eye response) in file VLAMBDA.DAT could still be
	used. (Note, however, that this file has been slightly changed to allow
	extended calculations to 780 nm.)
	ILLUM=1 and 2 now use the newer CIE (1988) Vlambda curve, with added
	accurracy, significant digits, and values up to 780 nm. The new dataset is
	in file VMLAMDA.DAT. (Thanks to Dominique Dumortier.)
	- Added a user-friendly interface to change the input and output filenames
	when the execution begins. (Thanks again to Dominique Dumortier.)
	- Changed the compiler for the Mac version. A single, fat binary
	executable for Mac is now offered, which will run native on both 68K and
	PPC machines. It is also accelerated for the PowerPC 604 chip.
	
	
*	VERSION 2.9.x, Feb. 2002 and later
	All new features are documented in the file 'SMARTS29X_Users_Manual.pdf'.
