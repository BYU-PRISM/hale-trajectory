* ATMOSPHERE : USSA        AEROSOL TYPE: S&F_TROPO                                                       

* INPUTS:
     Pressure (mb) =   25.490   Ground Altitude (km) =   0.0000
     Height above ground (km) =  25.0000
     Relative Humidity (%) =  0.214   Precipitable Water (cm) =  0.0001
     Ozone (atm-cm) = 0.1247 or 124.7 Dobson Units
   AEROSOLS:  Optical Depth at 500 nm = 0.0010      Optical depth at 550 nm = 0.0009
       Angstrom's Beta = 0.0004       Schuepp's B = 0.0004
     Meteorological Range (km) =    0.0   Visibility (km) =    0.0
     Alpha1 = 1.0550  Alpha2 = 1.3680   Mean Angstrom's Alpha = 1.2115
     Season = SPRING/SUMMER           

* TEMPERATURES:
     Instantaneous at site's altitude = 221.6 K
     Daily average (reference) at site's altitude = 221.6 K
     Stratospheric Ozone and NO2 (effective) = 230.5 K

** WARNING #20*********
\\ Receiver is at more than 6 km above sea level, hence the aerosol optical depth has been fixed to a default value, dependent only on altitude.

** WARNING #21*********
\\ Receiver is at more than 0,5 km above ground, hence the calculation of the reflected irradiance from the ground to the tilted plane is not accurate.

      Spectral ZONAL albedo data: SOIL                    
      with a reflection process: NON_LAMBERTIAN          


* GEOMETRY (half-angles) OF THE SIMULATED RADIOMETER (deg.):
   Slope =  0.00      Aperture =  2.90   Limit =  0.00

** WARNING #11*********
\\ The radiometer's Slope and Limit angles are not provided.
\\ Circumsolar calculations will therefore be performed for
\\ an average geometry corresponding to the Aperture angle.
