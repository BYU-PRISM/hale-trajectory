# High-Altitude Long-Endurance Aircraft Trajectory Optimization

This repository contains the code used to generate the results in the paper "Dynamic Optimization of High-Altitude Solar Aircraft Trajectories Under Station-Keeping Constraints".

The code produces energy optimal trajectories for solar powered HALE aircraft using the GEKKO Dynamic Optimization package.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

The project requires that the following Python libraries be installed.

```
pip install jsonpickle etc
```

SMARTS

## Running the code

Explain how to run the default optimization case.

### Settings

### Viewing Dashboard

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Custom Aircraft

Add additional notes about how to use a custom aircraft.
