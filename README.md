# High-Altitude Long-Endurance Aircraft Trajectory Optimization

This repository contains the code used to generate the results in the paper "Dynamic Optimization of High-Altitude Solar Aircraft Trajectories Under Station-Keeping Constraints".

The code produces energy optimal trajectories for solar powered HALE aircraft using the GEKKO Dynamic Optimization package.
